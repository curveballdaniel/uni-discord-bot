# uni-discord-bot
A simple Discord Uniswap bot which alerts when certain thresholds are met

# Starting up the bot

Simply run `node index.js` to start the bot! If the bot is not running, it will show as offline in the Discord server. Then, none of the commands will work.

# Required files

In order to correctly run the bot, a `TOKEN` env variable is required. This can be obtained from https://discord.com/developers/applications.
